<!-- DOM-----Document Object Model All HTML Document will organized
into a object model if javascript is added -->

<!-- The DOM (Document Object Model) is an API that represents and interacts with
     any HTML or XML-based markup language document. The DOM is a document model 
     loaded in the browser and representing the document as a node tree, or DOM tree, 
     where each node represents part of the document (e.g. an element, text string, or comment). -->
<!-- In Web development, an API is generally a set of code features (e.g. methods, properties, events, and URLs) that a developer can use in their apps for interacting with components of a user's web browser,
     other software/hardware on the user's computer, or third-party websites and services. -->
